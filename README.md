Angular with Firebase Authentication 

07/23/19
Currently the Authentication via Facebook, Google and Email are currently completed.
I am working on the Weather application that displays the current and 5 day weather for 
requested location. I plan to implement some sort of dashboard
for the financial link. 
I don't have my environment file attached 
which has the key to firebase so no access to the firebase site but code can be used
to work with your own firebase connection
